Rocket Mission
=============

Rocket Mission uses many feauters  of .NET 2.0 framework and you may consider it as a not so wise option concerning performance and you are right I didn't use DirectX or any other graphics library, but anyway I think it's a nice example on how things work in WinForms and .NET framework itself.
